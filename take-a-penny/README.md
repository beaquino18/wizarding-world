In this exercise, you will create a program that can keep track of a "Take a Penny" jar next to a cashier of a convenience store. The jar should only keep track of how many pennies are currently inside of it, and should start with 3 pennies already. You will also keep track of a list of items your shop sells and their prices inside either an Object or an Array. Your program wil simulate customers purchasing random items from the store. As the person checks out, console log the items purchased, the total amount in dollars for the items, as well as if the customer randomly takes or leaves a penny from the jar. This will continue until there are no more penny's left in the jar.

Requirements:

- Items & Prices are stored in an Array or Object
- A jar that keeps track of how many pennies are inside it
- A user purchases random items
- Items are console logged with their total price
- Console log if the customer takes or leaves a penny
- Repeat until all the pennies are gone

To run:
In terminal, 'ts-node take-a-penny/take-a-penny.ts'
